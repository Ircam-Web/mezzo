- Full Project data management including project pages, particpants, activities, demo repositories, etc.
- Personal project activity management per department
- Multi-site management with separated themes
- Translation ready models and templates
- Full modular architecture for easy customization
- Full docker packaging for easy scalable deployment on every platform


Use cases
==========

- Basic CMS
- More complex institutional or corporate web sites with a lot of structural data like departments, persons, projects, etc.

Architecture
============

For easier development and production workflow, this application has been fully dockerized.


Paths
+++++

The Mezzo architecture is designed to be as close as possible with a POSIX OS.

- app \
    django application

  - app/bin \
        commands to run the app inside docker containers
  - local_settings.py.sample \
        example settings to copy to local_settings.oy before starting anything
  - requirements.txt \
        python package dependencies

- bin \
    management tools
- doc \
    documentation
- env \
    docker-compose environment files
- etc \
    custom configuration files
- lib \
    default and custom libraries which will be mounted in app container
- var \
    local application data

  - var/backup \
        database backup directory
  - var/media \
        media uploaded through the app
  - var/lib/postgresql \
        postgresql DB (not versioned)
  - var/log/nginx \
        nginx logs (not versioned)
  - var/log/uwsgi \
        uwsgi logs (not versioned)

- requirements.txt \
    debian package dependencies
- docker-compose.yml \
    composition file for docker containers used by docker-compose
- Dockerfile \
    instructions to build the docker image of the app


Models
++++++

Main modules embed in app/organization

- agenda \
    manage events, using _Mezzanine-Agenda
- core \
    commons or abstract functionnality
- custom
    empty module for easy cutomization
- formats \
    manage date format
- job \
    jobs and candidacies for residency
- magazine \
    all news are managed by topics, articles and briefs
- media \
    audio and video gathered in playlist
- network \
    create a tree of Organizations > Departments > Teams > Persons
- pages \
    managing diffent type of pages (admin/pages/page/) and home
- projects \
    represent projects related to a team or a person
- shop \
    manage product from prestashop (softwares and subscriptions), using _Cartridge


Install
=======


Clone
+++++

First install Git_, Docker-engine_ and docker-compose_ and open a terminal.

On MacOS or Windows, you will maybe ned to install Docker-Toolbox_ and open a Docker Quickstart Terminal.

Then run these commands::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ircam-Web/Mezzo.git


Start
+++++

Our docker composition already bundles some powerful containers and bleeding edge frameworks like: Nginx, MySQL, Redis, Celery, Django and Python. It thus provides a safe and continuous way to deploy your project from an early development stage to a massive production environment.

For a production environment setup::

    cd Mezzo

Copy the local_settings sample::

    cp app/local_settings.py.sample app/local_settings.py

and edit your own local_settings, especially the SECRET_KEY parameter. Then::

    bin/prod/up.sh

which builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches all containers.

Then browse the app at http://localhost:9051/

On MacOS or Windows, you maybe need to replace 'localhost' by the IP given by the docker terminal.

.. warning :: Before any serious production usecase, you *must* modify all the passwords and secret keys in the configuration files of the sandbox.


Daemonize
+++++++++++

The install the entire composition so that it will be automatically run at boot and in the background::

    sudo bin/install/install.py

options::

    --uninstall : uninstall the daemon
    --cron : install cron backup rule (every 6 hours)
    --user : specify user for cron rule
    --systemd : use systemd
    --composition_file : the path of the YAML composition file to use (optional)

This will install a init script in /etc/init.d. For example, if your app directory is named `mezzanine-organization` then `/etc/init.d/mezzanine-organization` becomes the init script for the OS booting procedure and for you if you need to start the daemon by hand::

    sudo /etc/init.d/mezzo start


Development
===========

Dev mode
++++++++

For a development environment setup::

    bin/dev/up.sh

This will launch the django development server. Then browse the app at http://localhost:9021/

On MacOS or Windows, we need to replace 'localhost' by the IP given by the docker terminal.

.. warning :: In this mode, Django is run with the `runserver` tool in DEBUG mode. NEVER use this in production!


Backend
+++++++

If you modify or add django models, you can produce migration files with::

    bin/dev/makemigrations.sh

To apply new migrations::

    bin/dev/migrate.sh

Accessing the app container shell::

    docker-compose run app bash


Frontend
++++++++

The styles are written in SASS in app/static and the builder uses Gulp.
All the builing tools are included in the app container so that you can build the front in one command::

    bin/build/front.sh

Gulp will launch BrowserSync. BrowserSync is a middleware that expose the website on port 3000.
Any change on CSS or JS files will trigger the build system and reload the browser.


Maintenance
============

Log
++++

- var/log/nginx/app-access.log \
    nginx access log of the app
- var/log/nginx/app-error.log \
    nginx error log of the app
- var/log/uwsgi/app.log \
    uwsgi log of the app


Backup & restore the database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To backup the database and all the media, this will push all of them to the var submodule own repository::

    bin/prod/push_data.sh

.. warning :: use this ONLY from the **production** environment!

To restore the backuped the database, all the media and rebuild front ()::

    bin/dev/pull_data.sh

.. warning :: use this ONLY from the **development** environment!


Upgrade
+++++++++

Upgrade application, all dependencies, data from master branch and also recompile assets::

    bin/prod/upgrade.sh


Troubleshooting
+++++++++++++++

If the app is not accessible, first try to restart the composition with::

    docker-compose restart

If the app is not responding yet, try to restart the docker service and then the app::

    docker-compose stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart
    docker-compose up

If the containers are still broken, try to delete exisiting containers (this will NOT delete critical data as database or media)::

    docker-compose stop
    docker-compose rm
    docker-compose up

In case you have installed the init script to run the app as a daemon (cf. section "Daemonize"), you can use it to restart the app:

    /etc/init.d/mezzanine-organization restart

If you need more informations about running containers::

    docker-compose ps

Or more, inspecting any container of the composition (usefully to know IP of a container)::

    docker inspect [CONTAINER_ID]
